The project is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Key technical aspects likely include:
Models and Databases: Utilizing Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to define models that represent the data related to malnutrition and interact with a database.
Views and Templates: Implementing views to handle the logic of processing user requests and returning responses. Using templates to generate HTML dynamically for the user interface.
Admin Interface: Leveraging Django's built-in admin interface to manage the data (e.g., cases of malnutrition, user accounts, content) easily.
REST API: Possibly providing a RESTful API for data access and manipulation, making it easier to integrate with other systems or to develop mobile applications that interact with the project.
